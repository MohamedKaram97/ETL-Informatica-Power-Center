#Overview

This Informatica project involves Extracting, Transforming, and Loading (ETL) data from two CSV files: Churn_Modelling2.csv and Churn_Modelling3.csv. The objective is to perform various analyses on the data and generate specific outputs as outlined below.

#Tasks
1. Sum of Balances for Male and Female Customers
•	Calculate the sum of balances for male and female customers.
2. Number of Active Male and Female Customers
•	Determine the number of active male and female customers.
3. Customer Age Distribution
•	Group customers based on age distribution into the following categories:
o	Age between 18 and 30
o	Age between 30 and 45
o	Age above 45
4. Users with Available Balance Data
•	Identify users with available balance data (balance > 0) and rank them in ascending order.
5. Top 5 Balances
•	Retrieve all information for customers with the top 5 balances.
6. Highest and Lowest Credit Score Values
•	Find the highest and lowest credit score values.
 
#Outputs
•	SumBalance_M_F.txt: Sum of balances for male and female customers.

•	Count_Active.txt: Number of active male and female customers.

•	Age distribution tables.

•	Balance_Sorter.txt: Users with available balance data.

•	Rank_Balance.txt: Information for customers with the top 5 balances.

•	max_min_score.txt: Highest and lowest credit score values.

#Usage

1.	Ensure Informatica PowerCenter is installed and configured.
2.	
3.	Import the CSV files Churn_Modelling2.csv and Churn_Modelling3.csv into Informatica PowerCenter.
4.	
5.	Create mappings, transformations, and workflows to perform the specified tasks.
6.	
7.	Execute the workflows to generate the output files mentioned above.
   
Note
•	Ensure the input CSV files are correctly mapped within Informatica PowerCenter.

•	Validate the transformations and mappings to ensure accurate data processing.

•	Monitor the workflow execution for any errors or issues.

•	Adjust any parameters or configurations as needed to optimize performance and accuracy.
